Project title: Flappy bird in pygame
Course number: CS110
Semester: Spring 2023
Project Overview: This is supposed to be a basic flappy bird game however scores are not being counted and the game ends once the bird hits the ground or any pipes. This game also starts as soon as the program is running. Use the space bar to fly.
Modules used was the Sprites and GUI programming in chapter 8 of the lessons from class, main loops from chapter 4, events and if statements from chapter 3, classes from chapter 7.
All of the classes in this project was the different components of the game for example the bird, the ground and the pipes. These were classes for the game. The bird is the moving character and the ground and pipes were used so that if they bird was touching it, the game is over.
The data is straightforward as it is just how a flappy bird game is performed. The space keyboard is needed to use for the bird to move up as it is falling towards the ground. 
Wasn't sure how to add the screenshors of the Final GUI so I just added it to the file with everything.
The project is structured in the way it inits the game, then begins the scrolling background, the bird class, the ground class, the pipe class and then the game over close file.
